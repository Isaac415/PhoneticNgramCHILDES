books .
she's got several books , not like this .
this is one of the cutest books I've ever seen . it's a . an old one ?
it's cute .
she's got one of these . she likes to put things , . you know . but she has a Raggedy Ann doll , but . she's got some stuffed animals . but . two cats .
I don't . I really don't know . if she's that familiar with dogs .
, there is a dog where she . sometimes goes to the babysitter . named Suchi . in fact he looks like that little . stuffed dog . but . I don't really know if she sees him there or not .
one of them's kitty , and the other one has another name 
no . we just started calling it that . and 
yeah . very small ones .
she stacks them .
throws them .
carries em around , as many as she can at once .
I thought she might know kitty , but that's about the only thing .
I don't think so .
she might know boy .
she's been exposed to ducks , but I don't know how well she knows those . she loves them .
she brings them to me , and makes me go through them over and over .
and you know , sometimes she sits 
like that , by herself .
she looks at them .
no , she's got three of them , and a big one , but she just isn't interested .
yeah , just sit around !
not as much as we useta .
it's just . you said it was a dragon . so . I just thought of it as being a dragon 
yeah , I know what you mean . I .
it just never occurred to me to think of . you know it's a dragon . so that's what I called it .
she has a puppet .
sometimes she likes it .
she'll make that little noise . like she made with the dog .
very loving to it , and other times . she could care less about it .
no . and that was a new routine , I'd never done that with her .
yeah , she feeds herself !
yeah . combs and brushes she'll brush her hair . she'll try to brush my hair .
oh , did I ?
I just called it a bunny because it said bunny . on it , so . I don't think I've ever . no .
I think I've always used the word bunny . no . rabbit .
yeah , it seems like an easy thing to memorize , you know . one , two , three , four . I don't think so .
yeah , she has a number book at home one raccoon , two . something . it goes through a list of animals 
seven bunnies .
yeah , she lifts it up and goes that . hello , hello , hello . you know .
and . whenever the phone rings . if like sometimes her father calls from work and all that . I'll put it to her ear . and let her hear his voice .
she never says a word . but a big smile comes on her face .
she's got two toy ones .
one of them's just like this . a different color . and the other one . is more of a pull toy . it kind of . it has little eyes on it that roll up and down . and . makes kind of a clicking sound when you pull it and its . its . vividly colored .
I really don't know .
she useta wrap this one around her neck and walk around the house with it .
so . but she does do that 
hello , hello .
so , you know , so as though she had some connection .
she runs to the phone .
it's a big event .
it's not when she's done playing .
it can happen any time .
with any number of things . she likes to put things . in drawers and shut the drawers , . I'll find toys . in dresser drawers . and . just all over the place .
she likes to . seems to like to put things in a an orderly way .
not every time . once in a while I tell her , but . she does it on her own for the most part . put it away , something like that .
I think she knows put .
put it away , yeah .
