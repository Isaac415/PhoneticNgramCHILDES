you you could drive it .

Kevin's daddy ?

Kevin's daddy .
yeah .
are they really planning to sit in the a back of the truck ?
no . in the front . I think .
oh . because 
no . I wanna sit in the back of it .
oh . lemme tell you why you can't do that in the a moving truck .
because all the stuff's piled real high . boxes way up to the top of the truck and beds . and bookcases everywhere . and rugs all rolled up . and books . and chairs on the top . and if a little boy is inside and it should happen to all fall over . he would be smashed flat .
so that's why you .
because it gets 
but probably everybody will do it .
I think the people will ride in the front .
and I think it will not be open .
when you drive . yeah .
it will be closed when you drive .
hm .
you know what ?
what ?
it will have a a woof and den the things will a go like this .
also . if there are not seatbelts . he doesn't ride in it .
ummhm .
I agree .
because a . that's really when you're driving a truck 
mhm .
and you're not useta driving a truck 
right .
stopping too soon and things like that .
if there's no seatbelts . then we can go along in our car 
for sure .
and he can be near the truck .
why do we hafta go along in our car ?
because Shem and Kevin will not be able to ride in the truck if there's no seatbelts .
you need some seatbelts .
but I don't wanna do I don't wanna go in our my car !
I know . you'd rather go in the truck .
hey . Shem 
and if we can possibly work it out . we will .
yeah . let's cross that bridge when we get to it . as they say .
