somebody was here to have and and a the kid that was having the the tea party broke it .
oh . that's really too bad .
I think this boy is mowing it . and here's the mower . and he's mowing the grass . so so dis this can able to come by 
oh . you mean he's mowing the grass so that when this roller comes across here . it can go across the grass . too ?
yeah .
I don't think so . people don't usually get these big steamrollers to go over their grass . because it would kill the grass .
but they like to kill the grass .
how come ?
because they like to get it the street .
oh . but this is his lawn still . see . this isn't the street . this is still his yard .
oh . den why he's mowing it ?
why is he mowing it ?
because he wants his grass to be mowed .
oh . but he can be able to go this way .
yeah .
across this way . but dere's a lot a k kraek trackers .
but this is in the way . so so so the people cannot buy that machine .
oh . so . well . I don't understand . you mean this blockade is up here . this blocking thing is here to block the side to block the street . so that he can't go around here ?
the steam roller can't ?
no no . just just the people .
oh . so that the people can't go by .
yeah .
why don't they wanna let the people go by ?
because because that's very important .
and it might them and it might make them flat .
oh 
dat's why .
oh . you mean you think that the people are gonna be rolled over by the steamroller and flattened out like pancakes . huh ?
yeah .
oh . I see . well 
that happened at my at Tuti's house and Isabel's house .
the the roller came and all those machines came to put dat dat all that stuff from the so they can put some new holes in .
some new holes ?
yeah .
where's that ?
it's at Tuti's house and Isabel's house .
oh . you mean tar on the street ?
yeah .
oh . these rollers come to put that bumpy tar stuff on the street ?
yeah .
so there wouldn't be any more holes ?
yeah . well . people didn't get squashed in it . though . did they ?
no . because these these boys are watching that .
right . they're staying out of the way .
yeah 
right . well . you know . these steamrollers go very slowly . so that they can watch out who's going in front of them and they can always stop if they get are about to get run over .
yeah .
wind brings the smell of fresh bread and doughnuts from the bakery shop .
they make doughnuts here .

well . that's good . you know how to make popcorn .
do you make it very often ?
yeah .
when do you make it ?
in in the summertime or something .
hm .
yeah . let's finish .
okay 
animals can smell things that you cannot smell . sometimes they can tell where men and other animals are . watch a dog sniffing in the wind .
he seems to know when someone is near .
the rabbits are near .
the rabbits are near . and he can smell them .
wind brings your nose signals you cannot hear or see or feel .
this dog can smell these rabbits because their smell is going 
up to his nose . by the wind .
yeah yeah . and they are watching .
yeah . they're afraid because dogs try to hunt down rabbits . yeah . that's what dogs do to rabbits 
wind can help us work . windmills can pump water from wells deep in the ground .
this is not a windmill . but 
it is a windmill .
oh . this is just a thing that tells which way the wind is coming from .
what is this ?
that's a little tail that also if the wind is coming from this direction . it goes and pushes this little flag and then it goes like that . and then you know that the wind is coming from that direction .

oh . they wanna have their own so they tie it to here ?
yeah . that's their own boat and they wanna keep it .
