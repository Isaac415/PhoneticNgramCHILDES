I'm gonna eat some food .

I'm gonna eat my 
big and strong . 
so you'll be taller and . 
how big and strong do you want to be 8. ? 
can you believe when I get bigger and bigger and bigger ? 
and bigger and bigger . 
how big are you going to be 4. ? 
oh . 
what ? 
do you know what that might've been ? 
what ? 
that might've been a little boy . who tried to cross the street without looking . 
and a car at the last minute slammed its brakes on and came to a stop just in time . 
did you tell Dad what we did today ? 
who'd we see ? 
who ? 
remember ? 
who ?
who ? 
Judy and my friend . 
did we see Michael ? 
yes . 
Michael told me he was going to to work . 
oh . 
actually , Michael didn't come till this afternoon . 
was Mike at the beach ? 
no . 
no 3. . 
that's because he had to work too . 
whoa , I dropped one . 
mhm . 
dropped something . 
just a little bit . 
do you remember the name of the beach you went to ? 
hm ? 
not this time . 
you don't remember it this time ? 
it was Winger what ? 
Winger Beach ? 
yes . 
Winger Sheek Beach . 
Winger Sheek Beach . 
that's the one . 
Winger Beach . 
is that gonna be ? 
mm 
and if we go at the other end , .. come back and start that way ? 
that looks very rare . 
that looks better . 
yeah . 
why don't you start that way and I think it will cook more or less; this I can eat .. myself . 
I . can eat that . 
I can eat that . 
I'll put it back , except I'm just nervous that it will turn out to be . so overdone you won't like it . 
hm . 
did he manage to remember what he had done ? 
yeah . 
did you go swimming , Charlie ? 
yes . 
you did ? 
I went swimming , Dad . 
you did ? 
did you wear water wings ? 
yeah . 
no . 
no ? 
it wasn't very deep , was it , Charlie ? 
no , it wasn't very deep , Dad . 
and , and , and , and Sabina got the big boat . 
she got the big boat ? 
yeah . 
yeah ? 
where'd she get the big boat ? 
big row boat . 
oh . 
did she take you for a ride ? 
no , I wanted to go back with my Mom . 
you wanted to go back with your Mom ? 
but she took me for a ride . 
yeah ? 
she's very strong . 
why didn't you go for a ride with Sabina ? 
because I wanna go back to our car . 
you wanted to go back to the car . 
I see . 
he got a little nervous . 
mhm . 
it's a terrific place to go though cause they have a lot of tide and so you can get in the canoe and it takes you right out . 
mm hm . 
but it's not a canoe actually , it's a rowboat . 
mhm . 
it's not a canoe , it's not . 
oh , the tide's going out and it 
going out; it takes you out in a great rush . 
and then how do you get back ? 
and then you . 
I see . 
I I took . Sabina in my car . 
you did ? 
did you drive her ? 
there was also a mat too . 
wasn't there , Charlie ? 
what kind ? 
a mat is that thing you lie on in the water . 
it's not a boat . 
remember ? 
it's . 
a raft . 
it looks sorta like a boat . 
remember ? 
yes . 
well 
I remember . 
well , that's 
you used that 
that was better for Charlie 6. . 
well . 
the whole place was so good . 
cause there're all sorts of little .. pools around you . 
yeah . 
but low tide was at one or something like that , right ? 
I guess you're right . , because there when we gotta the beach there're incredible greenheads .. everywhere . 
but by the time we gotta the beach there was there was pools of water and leftover spaces and stuff like that and you could look for sand dollars that just washed up . 
mhm . 
mhm . 
Charlie didn't look for sand dollars . 
you mean you went to the ocean beach because there was greenheads on the back ? 
mhm . 
yeah . 
sand dollars . 
but there was a large pool and a little boy in a big pool . 
mhm . 
of the water was in it . 
mhm . 
but but there was a lot of water at the other pool . 
at at which other pool ? 
the big pool or the little pool ? 
the big pool . 
ahhah ! 
which one did you like the best ? 
the little one . 
hm ? 
the little one . 
how was the water ? 
was it cold ? 
hm ? 
we was dining the hole . 
you were digging a hole . 
that's right . 
and do you remember your lips turned blue ? 
lip turning blue ? 
lips turned blue ? 
very cold . 
remember that ? 
that's what little boys are for during the summertime . 
you put them in the water until they turn blue . 
without that summer is not complete . 
poor Sabina kept looking at Charlie as Judy and I oohed and aahed over Charlie's blue lips , and Sabina kept saying 
are mine blue ? 
hopefully . 
nothing was happening to Sabina . 
she looked just fine . 
she's too tough . 
she is . 
she's tough and older too . 
quite right . 
she showed Charlie a bunch of of .. comic books and . 
hum ? 
Charlie kept saying to me , 
read to me , Mom . 
read to me . 
mhm . 
Sabina carefully would read them to him in German . 
uhhuh . 
Charlie would never say a word , keep right on looking along . 
she had a Tom and Jerry comic , didn't she ? 
in German ? 
yep . 
wow . 
great . 
everything was in German 6. . 
say Charlie , try this . 
what ? 
no . 
you don't want to ? 
do you know what it is ? 
what ? 
it's a London Broil . 
and you've never had it before . 
that's delicious , Charlie . 
I don't . 
steak . 
look , I'm having the same thing and it's delicious . 
mm ! 
a little protein . 
what I meant to say to you earlier , about .. , Mike and Judy was that they said . 
I said that conceivable we would bring Sabina here for the night and then they would take us in the morning to see the tall ships . 
what morning was that ? 
Saturday morning at eight . 
but we'll do . 
ah . 
they have a place to go and look at . 
mhm . 
and 
where's that ? 
it's a warehouse on the wharf . 
mm 5. . 
the information I'm beginning to pick up is that what 
a noodle . 
noodle . 
mhm . 
noodle . 
coming in . maybe Saturday to . 
make the pass by the aquarium . 
yeah . 
yeah , and that's when the big public weekend display 
but it's not clear whether they'll have the sails up or not . 
for Europe or where ever they're going . with their sails . set and what have you . 
I got you . 
and Boise and Blanket , which is the travel agency that we use at work . , has .

mhm .

Mom ! 
hm ? 
hey terrific . 
terrific . 
here's the one I showed you . 
this this is what 
that was a surprise to have old Ralph call . 
mhm . 
nice . 
I was gonna talk some . 
I didn't know you were gonna 
hm ! 
or something ? 
well , I I said I would call him back . 
okay . 
is that alright with you ? 
did you need to talk to him about 
I didn't write the letter . 
and I want to explain to him why . 
I turned out , when I . got into it , but .. Pat Davis had been given three or four specific indications .. from , .. what's his face . 
oh . , to come down . 
to come down ! 
yeah . 
yeah . 
and , 
so I I talked it over with Nunan , who called up a couple of days after Ralph and I discussed it .. on something else . 
and said , ya know , I'd be more than happy to 
use this connection . 
use this connection to set up the meeting , but it would look a little silly seeing as he personally had been invited down twice . 
ya know . 
and , , why didn't he get on the ball and just sorta . tell the guy he was coming down . 
and Pat said in fact he was going to Jacksonville anyway in two weeks and would call him . 
and . I don't know whether he did or not . 
I feel as if you oughta tell Ralphy that . 
yeah . 
uhhuh 7. . 
hey , Charlie ? 
come give one more try and then we'll have some dessert . 
no ! 
okay . 
I don't like it .

will you have a piece of turkey turkey roll , piece of chicken ? 
no . 
like your sandwich . 
no , I wanna have cake first . 
no , you can't have cake until you have something healthy . 
cake is delicious , but you have something healthy first . 
I'll show you what I'll give you instead , how's that ? 
what ? 
watch this . 
no , I like cake . 
oh , you can have cake too ! 
what is in there ? 
will you eat a piece of this ?

okay . 
then no cake . 
but Mom I want cake . 
what's the basic layer of the cake ?

all those things . 
Charlie , are you trying to dry your eye with a tassel ? 
hm . 
please .

why ? 
cause that will guarantee you a place in hea a place piece of cake . 
there you go . 
see that corn right there ? 
yeah . 
let's try and clean that up . 
can you do that by yourself ? 
mhm . 
I'm trying 7. . 
that's the way Japanese people eat rice , Charlie . 
shove it in off the side of the plate . 
perfect . 
now can I have some cake ? 
you bet ! 
you stay right here . 
in fact you get up in your seat . 
and I will work wonders for you . 
would you like it with some chocolate ice cream ? 
yeah . 
you bet ! 
oh , watch your glass , please . 
mm ? 
let's hold that . 
okay . 
hm ! 
not quite ready yet ? 
Dad ? 
yes Charlie ? 
who's that spoon ? 
that is the gravy spoon . 
all the juice from the meat runs into that little hole then you spoon it out 6. . 
isn't that running in ? 
well , it was running in . 
see all these little holes in the tracks down here ? 
yes . 
when you cut the meat , the juice runs out of the meat .. into that little track there . 
runs down till it gets to that hole . 
blew up ! 
fills it right up . 
Ma . 
the way rivers and lakes work . 
I can't 
look at that . 
fantastic ! 
look what I got . 
wow ! 
look what you got . 
wow ! 
a little ice cream . 
and . 
wowie ? 
dessert I mean your soup ? 
I ate it , mm . 
good . 
Ma , where are the candles ? 
you had the candles yesterday , remember ? 
and you blew them all out . 
Dad , I blowed the candles all out . 
in one breath ? 
Charlie , if yesterday was July was your birthday , what day was it ? 
school day . 
July what ? 
July sixth . 
July sixth ! 
you bet ! 
school day . 
it was also a school day , that's true . 
you're going to lick all that ice cream off that cake ? 
and then it won't be as good . 
then he won't hafta eat the cake . 
mhm . 
when I took this in to school you should have heard the teacher lamenting .. as they would throw away plateful of of cake after plateful of cake . 
mhm . 
it was just 
as far as I can tell kids are just not . big cake and ice cream eaters . 
hm 4. . 
an old myth 11. . 
bum , bum , bum . 
it's delicious ! 
delicious ! 
delicious and what else ? 
scrumptious . 
scrumptious ! 
and what else ? 
cute . 
cute ? 
what else goes with delicious 
delicious is part of like delicious . 
and what goes with delicious ? 
scrumptious . 
huh ? 
scrumptious . 
scrumptious ? 
what about nutritious ? 
delicious , nutritious ? 
remember that ? 
no ? 
nope ! 
not that one . 
I think that's a anyway , isn't it ? 
hm . 
it might be . 
I'm not sure about that point . 
tastes so . 
I had the usual conversation with Judy about . whether or not they apparently , I forget why 
she and Mike stayed up til one thirty or two last night discussing whether or not they would have children . 
and what their prioritys was , and what they wanted out of their lives and what kind of people they was and . gotta me . 
that's pretty heavy . 
I said if you hafta .. really start really considering it , it's impossible to make that kind of decision , you know ? 
you looked cheery and healthy this morning . 
you think that would make me look sick and ill ? 
well , probably . 
all the questions that you feel that you probably oughta ask , but most people don't , on how why am I bringing these children into the world . 
uhhuh . 
and what kind of life do I hope for them 
yeah . 
do you think she has a strong 
well , it's funny , that for for a person who . makes a point of .. dedicating herself to the solution of human problems etcetera , , . 
, , to say , you should be unrestrained in your in the reproduction of your species because essentially it's fun , which was what her defense was . 
having kids is . . 
a source of satisfaction to the parents . 
not necessarily that it was . good for the kids or anything else . 
that that they was a comfort in their old age and . so forth . 
what she was saying to me was . , hm , . having kids . , having more than one , . more than two even , is okay if you're if you're the rich and privileged class essentially . 
but that's terribly elitist . 
because how long does she expect . people to be members of the class in which they presently find themselves ? 
let's say , ya know , a generation down the road may be two or three . 
I mean . 
ya know , you have your Adams familys and stuff like that . 
you look at 
ya know . there was a thing in Time magazine this week on descendants of the , , . . 
and they're plumbers an and whatever , ? 
mhm . 
mhm . 
and there's no guarantee that that .. when you're talking about a problem the consequences of which . , are not really gonna be 
well , they will be felt immediately . 
but . 
a problem that is going to become critical in say one more generation or two more generations . 
mhm . 
by which time you have no reason to expect that your progeny are gonna have the same 
values . 
well , or the or the same resources that you're gonna hafta bring up their children as . 
but what she assumes is that your progeny . 
are much brighter than than the average American's brightness . 
okay , that that in itself is false . 
even if they are . brighter it doesn't mean that they're gonna be . economically self sustaining . 
and even if they are economically self sustaining they're gonna take up space and they're gonna compete for . resources with everybody else . 
Ma I dropped some . 
they're gonna buy , ya know 
what . 
I spilled some , I spilled some , I spilled some . 
was gonna split between the three . . 
that's okay , sweetie . 
male heirs or however they . decide to . 
the conservationist's point of view , and it would be interesting to hear 
well , e even even from a 
something like that . 
does she want that ? 
I don't know whether she 
it seems to me she's taking very much in the attitude of 
I find pleasure in it right now and it's somebody else's problem later . 
you think that's the way she's viewing it ? 
I spilled it . 
in a funny position in that she's now very much of a a women's movement member . 
hm . 
but where . she spent her life bringing up her children and doing nothing but bringing up her children . 
uhhuh . 
until they was . high school age . 
mhm . 
you can't really say . that was a total waste of time . 
mhm . 
first of all she doesn't . 
yeah . 
doesn't wanna believe it . 
yeah . 
see what I'm aiming at is that arguments for population control don't say that that bringing up children is a waste , . by any means . 
mhm . 
huh . 
yeah . 
it acknowledges the fact that children are , ya know , a rare and . unique pleasure . 
and so it's just like a lot of other rare and unique pleasures like .. driving a twelve cylinder car at eighty miles an hour . 
it seems to me that ya , 
I can understand two , but more than two , no matter . how talented and clever you may think you are 
if you're talented and clever enough to feel those people who aren't will have too many children then you hafta more than make up for your share . 
it just gets a little funny because first it's distinctly 
ya know , people say that 
uhhuh . 
hey you . 
that's no good . 
if you don't wanna eat it that's okay too . 
but I don't want you playing with it . 
no good to play . 
spoon is very good for cake . 
spoon is much better for cake for you 5. . 
what she expresses a lot of concern for , and seems to have a genuine concern for , is reflected in the programs in the Y and so forth . 
ya know , the . the disenfranchised , the disadvantaged , the poor , the needy and so forth and so on . 
and then she turns around and says . that , .. . 
what are you doing ? 
whaddaya whaddaya whaddaya 
because yours 
yeah . 
that's the obvious implication . 
it is . 
it's true . 
which which strikes me as . ya know . , elitist in the extreme . 
well , it is . 
you're quite right 7. . 
it makes her .. so obviously contented . 
that . . 
uhhuh . 
may explain why . she has so much trouble getting along with . 
hasta deal with . 
I wanna fix my . 
I hate to say that I go both ways . 
not so much on the issue of .. of . 
having more than two , . but when I talk to her I'm she or somebody like her and they say .. you should have more . 
Ma , . 
Ma , please get me out of here . 
first I hafta clean you off . 
would you wait here ? 
hey ! 
what's up ? 
I don't want any . 
you don't want any . 
I think you have enough on your shirt . to last you through a long cold winter . 
let's see your face . 
hey , you know what would happen if I weren't holding on to this chair ? 
what ? 
and you were climbing up on it like that ? 
yes . 
you'd fall on your nose . 
hey ! 
get down , sweetie . 
that's not that's not safe .
