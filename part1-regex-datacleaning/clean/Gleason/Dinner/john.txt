and then after I tell you , Abba will tell you and you will tell me if it's the same , okay ? 
if it's approximately the same story . 
want some juice ? 
no I want apple juice . 
well 
Rachi and I . went and tried to park our car . 
it was pretty hard to find a parking space near there . 
jammed up like anything . 
Harold , would you help her a little bit ? 
what's a matter ? 
there was long , long lines of people . 
when you finally got in you saw five no five on each side ten like booths 
little gray , like little teeny houses . . 
very teeny . 
just big enough for one person . 
yeah , and they was all just for one person ? 
they was what ? 
and they was too little . 
they was too little ? 
yeah , they was just big enough for one person . 
Rachi and I went in . 
and you push a a lever like a little button on the side . 
something you push down . 
I think to the right . 
and the curtains close behind you , so only you are inside . 
and nobody can see what you're voting . 
remember ? 
and then you push down the little levers . 
like one says and one says 
Ford . 
and who are the candidates for Congress ? 
Senate ? 
Congress, I think ? 
Neelea . 
okay . 
and the other guy I forgot . 
but who's the ? 
Nealea . 
one who's running for reelection . 
give me . 
congressman ? 
the U S Congress . 
O'Neil . 
was it O'Neil ? 
yeah , I was glad . 
I didn't even know we was in 
I felt so . 
I thought we was in Drinan's district . 
no , that's Brookline and Newton . 
what did you say , John ? 
give me give me apple juice . 
okay . 
at the very end then you press 
after you vote for all the people you want to vote , like one person for President , one person for senator 
you vote for different things . 
you then when you're all done you press that lever to the left . 
but if you press two for one thing like if you press two people for President, it won't work . 
would you want to press the whole thing to finish voting , it won't work . 
it won't click . 
it'll be stuck . 
I think . 
well . 
is that right ? 
unh . 
I love these mushrooms . 
so another words , . voting machines can't be void . 
only paper ballot . 
look . 
and that's what happened . 
got some . 
what ? 
look . 
Donald Duck's . 
yeah , . 
then the the machine wouldn't work . 
when you tried to press it off . on at the very end of all your voting you hafta press one pin . to make the machine click . 
and that way your turn is finished . 
but if 
what is that called Ima ? 
the voting machine . 
the polling place . 
no , what that I go in your box . 
oh , this ? 
, meat and rice . 
you want some more ? 
yeh . 
I want some , too . 
okay , me , too . 
so , if you didn't click 
if you voted for more than one , then at the very end when you go to press it down . it won't click . 
and change it . until you change it to vote for only one of them . 
that was cute . 
can she have one of ? 
here , John , here's more . 
showing you a picture of Carter and Ford . 
who did you say showed you a picture of Carter and Ford ? 
here . 
you want some ? 
my 
the teacher showed a a picture of President Ford and Jimmy Carter . 
oh . 
and whom did you like better ? 
what should he vote , by look ? 
isn't that all ? 
who would you vote for .. , John ? 
John , tell me . 
he said he told me before he would vote for President Ford . 
you'd vote for ? 
Rachi John , who would you vote for ? 
vote for 
cookie . 
I think that sounds like the Cookie Monster . 
the Cookie Monster . 
I don't think . 
Mr Hooper likes cookies . 
he loves cookies . 
oh . 
you like that ? 
I might 
cookies . 
I might make a picture . 
might draw . 
that was at play group ? 
yeah ,

Cookie Monster hasta rest until Halloween comes . 
Halloween ? 
on Halloween when we have a mask . 
yeah . 
also on Purim you can have a mask . 
remember last year ? 
of course I remember Halloween 
sure . 
I think I'll be 
boy , am I glad . 
aw , Haman . 
I can't stand the suspense . 
oh . 
I'll be 
stand the suspense ? 
I'll be 
Haman . 
Haman ? 
why do you want to be Haman ? 
I figured you would . 
I just figured you would . 
do you think . the Chanakkah outfit would fit on him ? 
I don't know . 
it might be too small already . 
drink you milk . 
his teacher , Jackie , asked me where we got his shirt . 
mhm . 
he was wearing yesterday his shirt . 
yeah . 
so she asked me where we got it . 
she said her daughter gave a friend who went back to Israel a present of a Cookie Monster shirt . 
so , the friend wants to have printed on it in Hebrew . daughter wants it . 
yeah . 
so the this is my best friend . 
I don't know . 
oh , yeah . 
so she asked me if I know of any place where they print . 
I thought what a fantastic business in New York that would be . 
yeah . 
here it wouldn't be good . 
I told her to ask the Hebrew Bulletin . 
they'll probably throw her out of the store . 
I don't doubt it . 
let's eat . 
well , just in general Carter . 
Jimmy Carter . 
who would you vote for ? 
I'd vote on Carter 
I would vote . 
when we went to vote , remember 
do you know what Carter was before ? 
what ? 
he was a farmer . 
this is terrible . 
I mean 
and know what he grew on his farm ? 
what ? 
guess . 
please . 
no . 
I don't want to . 
you know what he grew on his farm ? 
no . 
peanuts ! 
really ! 
that humor . 
so what huh . 
I still have a . 
I remember when I was in second grade 
they say he wasn't a good peanut farmer altogether . 
uhuh . 
yeah . 
that's right . 
he left 
no . 
he was never a peanut farmer . 
he's a broker . 
a peanut broker . 
he doesn't grow peanuts . 
he buys them from the surrounding farms . 
oh . 
and he sells them . 
I don't know which is I don't know what's true . 
who cares . 
where else was Jimmy Carter ? 
a funny guy . 
he was a captain in a submarine . 
that's true . 
and he was also a Governor . 
he was in charge of the whole state , but not the state of Massachusetts . 
why , why . 
why , why , why ? 
cause every state needs somebody in charge of it . 
supposedly . 
John , why don't ya why don't you eat your meat ? 
you like that ? 
I remember when in the second grade they had a mock election 
they had a mock election today . 
am I right ? 
oops . 
yeah , who came in . 
very interesting though 
you had to push the little things and then you push you push the big thing . 
and then the curtains opened . 
and then you were finished . 
and then you went out of the building . 
and then the next person got a chance . 
, it's very , very good . 
I go in for , Ford, where 
and and a 
but I don't even know his name . 
and and , what's his name ? 
I didn't know . 
oh , yeah , right . 
we said we were going to hear your story . 
what story ? 
voting . 
we said I would say mine and then you would how it was when you voted . 
I ran up . 
practically nobody there . 
I thought it would be packed . 
but apparently it was just after the lunchtime rush . 
I went into the booth . 
I pushed all the levers on one line . 
I didn't no , I didn't . 
I voted for 
register of deeds . 
I did not vote for Mrs Hicks . 
oh , you know , I may have voted for her . 
the Democrat and I figured should I vote for the Democrat 
why, . 
I made I was propagandized by Smith's ads . 
no . 
what I did was I I stopped for each of the resolutions . 
I read each of the 
I did too . 
and voted . 
and then 
some of then had no opposition . 
I know . 
not the resolutions , the candidates . 
yeah , candidates . 
whoever you don't vote for . 
who had no opposition . 
that's right . 
whoever you don't vote for . 
well , even if we voted for somebody else 
who whoever you vote for . 
isn't the President 
yeah . 
the only thing is that . 
let's say we voted for one person but all the other people voted for another person . 
the other person would win . 
no . 
I see how it works . 
I took my time on the resolutions , the referendum questions . 
and what if we 
all finished ? 
that's okay . 
okay and we will go ah 
you hafta urinate ? 
you sure ? 
if everyone voted ? 
I didn't even 
were running unopposed> . 
if every and one person voted for President Ford , Jimmy Carter would win . 
that's true . 
Jimmy Carter would win . 
I just wanted to make sure last time 
that .. what ? 
I going in there . 
I don't think so . 
because they're working in there . 
and they don't want you to come there now . 
after when they're finished you can come there .

and me finished .
