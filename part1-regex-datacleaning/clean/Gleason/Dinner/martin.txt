I oh . 
and moaning about everything . 
, hee . 
harder ? 
I'd rather he didn't leave it . 
I'd rather have a different kind of roof . 
oh , you would ? 
I thought it would be cheaper . 
gonna look dumb . 
and he wants to put another on of those 
you go out and take a look . 
first of all , the roof looks dumb 
does look dumb 
alright . 
over those sliding glass doors . 
but he didn't he didn't 
right . 
what to do about 
remember 
side anyways . 
and he's gonna put in a pillar even though the pillar might block the view . 
well , he , we discussed it , remember ? 
if you're building a deck that'll be , ya know , two hundred dollars . 
if ya wanna put a roof on , he's gotta put in concrete footings , a foundation , cause it's gotta bear 
he's gonna do now ? 
bear a lotta weight to put up columns and . 
he's gonna use the steps as the foundation . 
he wants to . 
he really wants it to be concrete back there is what it comes right down to . 
and he'd like to use the the steps rather than take them down . 
he'd like to use them as the foundation . 
well . 
if he's gonna cut 
achoo ! 
ahhah haha haha ! 
he'll build a deck right out 
well , the thing 
we were gonna do that that's fine . 
except those steps are too high . 
problem . 
so what's he gonna do about that ? 
I don't know . 
raise the house up . 
cause the problem is about that is you have a mini step you have a step that's too big and that's that's part of why Martin trips coming down there . 
I don't want have it if someone's gonna trip . 
right on the concrete .
