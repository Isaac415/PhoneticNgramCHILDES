yeah .
there's the catchup .
only the kids that go , , are all Nanette's age .
and nobody will read them a story .
because they think they're too young .
but we've developed this wonderful playgroup .
so every week the same mothers go with the same kids .
and it's not like bringing a playgroup to your house .
and they've got all the toys . and records , and .
and it's just wonderful .
I don't know whether they've caught on yet .
but 
to today they might have caught on .
because , remember last time , we wore the earphones , when we listened to the record ?
yeah .
what did we do this time ?

we heard it without the earphones because we we , , were playing the earphones so loud that the man gave us the actual speaker .
and we was the only ones in the library and they were playing .

cause she told me earlier today she was gonna bang me .
are you mad at me ?
