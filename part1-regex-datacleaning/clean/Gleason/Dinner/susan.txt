really ? 
mhm . 
yep ! 
well , it couldn't have melted that much . 
well , it's pulling where people have had their sidewalks plowed the snow's pulling away and you can see grass in certain places . 
hm . 
gee . 
yep . 
mm . 
I did my long walk . 
I gotta good shoes . 
my feet are really beginning to hurt . 
my arches hurt . 
mm . 
okay . 
that's one that's the one thing .. . 
we'll . 
in a shoe shoe store , that has all different kinds of shoes that don't hurt your toes . 
that's right ! 
well , Betty Hossefatt , in Ron's , told me that there's a store in Cambridge called the Run a thon . 
it sells excellent shoes for joggers . 
being that I am walking briskly on A M aerobics program , I was thinking of going there . 
okay . 
well if we have time tomorrow then we can buy some . special shoes tomorrow . for you . 
mhm . 
can jog every day 15. . 
got an estimate from Norstrom . 
one thousand dollars if we do the work , . 
if he does the work . 
Mommy ? 
is this the one you like ? 
no . 
Mommy , I wan you pour me some milk . 
he was just very quiet . 
of three hundred . 
we you had a three hundred bid , didn't you ? 
yeah , right . 
I think Bob Higgens is gonna get our 
did you laugh in his face ? 
no , he sent me it in the mail . 
mm . 
try this . 
it was very well written up though . 
I'm sorry . 
have another one . 
did you describe anything to me about Norstrom ? 
no , but he came in a suit . and a tie .. . 
very quiet , . 
who's the guy you liked the best ? 
Sherman . 
and I haven't gotten his yet . 
oh . 
but I imagine his is going to be comparable . 
hm . 
I just . have this feeling . 
I don't know , Bob Higgens seems to be more in our . price range . 
and what was his bid ? 
three hundred and six hundred ? 
yeah . 
think he's gonna get the job ? 
what ? 
think I'm going to get the job ? 
no . 
you think he's gonna get the job ? 
well , I mean , if Sherman comes up with a two thousand for him to do all the work , I think Bob Higgens is gonna get the job , yeah . 
I mean , that's . 
yeah , we can just tell Higgens we want him to put up the new plaster board . 
yeah , well , I I'm sure that will increase it , you know , somewhat , but 
six ? 
no ten . 
oh . 
ten or eleven . 
how many total have you ? 
at all that tomato . 
Mommy , look at . 
huh . 
tomato sauce in my milk . 
oh , yeah . 
know why ? 
cause you got some on your mouth and then it 
Sherman's the only one out ? 
mhm . 
yep ! 
Norstrom and Sherman came the same day . 
Norstrom is 
get Sherman's tomorrow . 
Norstrom is high ? 
he's the highest so far . 
there was another 
yes , he is the highest so far because .. Billy England , , was my first one and he was the highest . 
for him to do just the preparation , cause I never asked him if he would do everything . 
his was only 
his was 
I mean like , maybe four hundred or five hundred . 
uhhuh . 
and that was the highest . for preparation but 
is the rule of thumb , you know , you double whatever their preparation is and you get their paying cost ? 
no , I don't know what the rule of thumb is because . I didn't ask them all that question . 
because it wasn't until I was half way through talking to these people that you decided that you decided that maybe it would be worth us asking . 
Mommy , would you help me get it back in ? 
how many , , people did you ask in all ? 
the last four . 
now three of them have doubled it ? 
Mommy . 
yeah . 
the last four , two doubled it , and one only gave me an estimate for when he did all the work . 
and you never gave anything back from that called up and you answered . 
mm . 
see , that's why it would've been nice if you'd taken me seriously when I first started talking . 
hm . 
otherwise I could've had twelve estimates . 
oh here now . 
it wasn't that I didn't take you seriously . 
it's just that I just didn't . think at the time about how unrealistic it would be for you to try to do the painting yourself . 
that's cause I don't think that you got really into it . 
more milk ! 
that's true . 
I didn't get into it . 
I wish you'd gotten into it at the time when I started discussing it . 
I think I made too much here . 
we're not going to be eating all of this . 
how are you doing , Susan ? 
so much here too , I'm not going to eat all of this . 
this is too much . 
well , you eat as much as you can . 
oops ! 
some of it . 
nice . 
you can go to nursery school tomorrow . 
I thought we wouldn't be able to . 
but why . 
why ? 
because we're not going to leave for New Jersey until after . nursery school's over . 
why ? 
cause Daddy has some work until then 5. . 
you can put up you can go and visit your auntie again and all those pretty clothes . 
when you get dressed up when you're over there . 
and would you stay for for a couple of minutes . there ? 
you'd like me to stay there for a little bit ? 
yes , so I can show you my my auntie . 
you want me to be your auntie ? 
yeah . 
okay , I I'll stay a little bit . 
I'd like to walk too though . 
okay ? 
okay . 
would you . 
Mommy , I'm full now . 
you're full ? 
where did you get this jammie blanket ? 
oh ! 
at Jack's . 
did Mommy and you go , , this afternoon ? 
yeah . 
mm . 
it's a size six . 
it's a size six . 
but 
for a six year old ? 
no kidding ! 
now that's twice as big and old as you . 
I finally found out where Jack's is . 
I drove past it on my way way to Jane Cook's . 
so I know where that store is now . 
hm ? 
does she live in Briggffona ? 
yeah . 
oh 11. . 
you hafta pull em up like a skirt when you walk . 
that's because they fall to the floor . 
poor Andrea called today . 
why is she poor ? 
well because she was thinking of enrolling Beth . 
and I told her . 
I'm I'd like to come next week . . 
mm . 
to the nursery school and I 
smell . 
said Andrea it's already . enrolled for next year . 
Mommy , what are these ? 
what are these all around it ? 
petals . 
petals . 
well , why do they have petals ? 
mm . 
why does a flower . 
I think that . this is supposed to be where the pollen . is . 
and the petals are pretty colors that attract bees so they'll come . and make the honey . 
how can bees make honey in this kind of flower ? 
well , that's not a real flower . 
I know ! 
so they can't . 
you're right , they can't . 
but from a real flower they could make honey . 
but what I mean 
why can't they make honey in a pretend flower ? 
because there's no nectar . in a pretend flower . 
only in real flowers . 
but why isn't there ? 
why isn't there ? 
well , cause that's just made out of . straw or something . 
it's not . 
actually , the bees make the honey in their bodys . 
they just use the pollen to do it . 
no . 
is it pollen ? 
pollen and nectar . 
listen we just read a book yesterday about bees making honey . 
hm ! 
they use pollen and nectar ? 
mhm . 
what is nectar ? 
I'll show you . 
Susan'll show you . 
I'll show you all about it . 
, bees . 
about the worker bees . 
I know everything about that . 
mhm . 
Susan knows all about the worker bees . 
and the queen bee . 
I'll just show you all about it . 
now tell me where it starts . 
I'll show you where it starts . 
okay . 
now , whenever 8. okay . 
now , whatever they do . 
mm . 
okay , when whenever the bees land to everywhere they go , then they have . whichever they want . 
yeah . 
now , whenever they they there an whatever their there they don't understand where they want to go . 
now those bees are going very far away to get some honey . 
mhm . 
and how they gonna go home ? 
I . don't know how they're gonna . get there . 
but they might 
I don't know how they're gonna return . 
but the Mommy go turn around . 
flop , flop , flop , flop, flop . 
and the go . 
are those their wings going flop , flop , flop ? 
no . 
flap . 
flap . 
flap , flap , flap . 
mhm . 
I don't know that say . 
and those are 
are those milkweed pods ? 
wait a minute , what kind of weeds are those . 
no , that's clover . 
clover ! 
right . 
what a dummy I am . 
but what about the nectar and the pollen ? 
that's the part . I'm interested in . 
yes . 
but some . 
and some may even fall down on the floor . 
mm . 
some of them die . 
hm . 
alright ? 
hm ? 
that's right . 
how come ? 
well just because they fall or something . 
now 
they work until they die . 
whenever that 
I know that this'll babys . 
oh . 
I I know that this I know that this is only a pretends . 
and most of their 
oh no this is real . 
they really do this , Susan . 
yeah . 
I know . 
but this is only a pretend story for to lay her eggs . 
hm . 
but in real life bees do lay eggs , just like that . 
the queen bee should be 
only the queen bee lays eggs . 
hm . 
your right . 
yeah ! 
I'm not sure is those are the babys or not . 
I'm not sure , but maybe . 
I'm not sure . 
hm . 
and these little things are the cells in the honeycomb . 
yep . 
where . 
but those are still the workers . 
hm . 
and they're coming out 
he's coming out of a cell ? 
mm , yeah . 
has he just been born ? 
I don't think so . 
he's the worker bee but 
how can you tell ? 
can you can tell from looking at him he's a worker bee ? 
yes but I'm not so sure the baby or not . 
I'm not sure about the bees . 
hm . 
they don't discuss that with 
now ! 
that man . 
putting honey in it . 
oh . he's collecting it . from the hives . 
yes . 
and those are skunks , right ? 
what are they doing ? 
they're in the grass . 
mm . 
well . know an interesting thing is that bees don't fly at night time because they don't see and they come out to what the problem is and the skunks eat them . 
oh really ? 
skunks eat bees ? 
yep ? 
they're . 
yeah . 
there only one . 
hm . 
only one bee is there to make her flower to make some honey . 
hm .
but that's the only bee in in the story . 
well . 
thank you . 
you did a very good job of interpreting that for me , Susan . 
yup ! 
everything I eat , right ? 
maybe we can go over that again at coffee time . 
okay , and I'll show you all the pictures about . doing the worker bees and things like that . 
would you like a little more spaghetti ? 
no . 
got a mouthful . 
and I got some newspaper . 
hm . 
that come in the mail today ? 
yeah . 
no , not today . 
now you can look at it . 
all these people . I think are are going on airplane . 
I think . 
hm . 
now just look closely . 
okay , , I looked closely . 
it looks to me like they're all consuming . 
looks like they're at the check out counter of a supermarket and they're all buying things and that's what the people who make this newspaper would like us to do . 
yeah . 
but . I'm not sure , but maybe . 
I'm not sure , but maybe . 
you're very handy with that chair . 
yeah . 
well look . 
I can carry it . 
oh what muscles ! 
yeah .
