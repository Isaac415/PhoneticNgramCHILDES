want me . to twirl your spaghetti around . 
please I don't want to eat it . 
I'll help you do that okay ?

I decided to put some chicken in the spaghetti because that's the way Auntie Charlotte used to do it . 
what ? 
remember Auntie Charlotte ? 
Danny and Mary's mommy ? 
used to feed you spaghetti sauce every afternoon at four o'clock ? 
that's the way . 
I like the way that 
but, remember when Liz had to go on my party . 
on what ? 
when Liz had to go on my party . 
last year ? 
oh when Liz went to your birthday party . 
had to go 
and she had to go . 
she couldn't stay for the whole thing .

if you think about 
Clifford and

Mommy would be mad . 
oh . 
she did that if she had I don't . 
, okay ? 
I won't give her the money for it . 
but y you don't . 
there's nothing wrong with twisting it . 
yeah , but I had to think about whether or not it was a case for because it really didn't belong to her . 
but we 
and I decided that it was like when you found that plastic coin in the parking lot and we didn't know who it belonged to and there was no way of finding out . 
so we said you could keep it but you know , you can't always find and keep things . 
but 
if you know who they belong to 
but this is for everybody . 
yeah . 
yeah but but you know if you found 
something that belongs to somebody .. . 
Elana , it's empty .

you can cut your fingers .
