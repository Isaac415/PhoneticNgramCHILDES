she was cross at me when I was a kitty .

and she went up . 
and she asked a policeman what she should do cause she really didn't know what to do . 
Chooklee had never been lost before . 
so here's the policeman .

so look . 
there's Chooklee . 
let's see what happens . 
so they went up and they tried to catch Chooklee .

and he went up and he tiptoed up . so Chooklee wouldn't notice . 
and he took a great , big jump and tried to catch the cat . 
but the cat got away .

the cat running away . 
and Olivia's here . 
and Olivia's looking at the whole thing .

and the cat ran down to get her . 
and the cat ran down to see . 
cause he didn't do anything . 
fell right into the water . 
look .
