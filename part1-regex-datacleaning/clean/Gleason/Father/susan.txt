well there are some fun things for us to do in here , lovie . 
okay . 
should we start off with that story ? 
yeah . 
okay . 
I think it's over in this box here . 
okay . 
she told that . 
I'm gonna I'm gonna I'm sit in this chair . 
okay . 
it's so so heavy . 
carry it over for me ? 
be glad to . 
maybe you can slide it . 
see if it'll see if it'll slide . 
push . 
that's it . 
yep . 
turn it around . 
that's like the camera we have at home . 
this is a story called . 
The great cat chase . 
oh . 
it's a Mercer Mayer . book . 
she's the one who wrote the story you have about the the monsters ? 
you remember ? 
with the with the Gololopus ? 
yeah . 
and the letter eating . the letter eating 
I can't remember what it was . 
it was a letter eating something . 
yeah . 
remember that one ? 
yeah . 
well there is a lady . taking her . dog for a walk . 
no . 
her cat . 
oh . 
excuse me . 
yes . 
her cat . 
she's taking her cat for a walk in a little carriage there . 
tsk . 
and she looks . kinda bundled up , doesn't she , that pussy cat ? 
yeah . 
are you comfortable ? 
she stops . to . pick up her roller skates . 
actually , she's picking a flower . 
and look what the cat does . 
the cat jumps out of the carriage . 
and she runs around and hides . behind this tree . 
and the lady is very , very upset . 
“oh , dear” , she says . 
oh dear . 
where is that cat ? 
she's so excited she throws her arms up in the air . 
and the flower goes . a scooting off through the air . 
she's feeling very upset . 
why ? 
because her pussy cat 
she's probably 
maybe she calls it a baby just like you do . 
her her her baby her pussy cat is gone . 
she doesn't know where she is . 
I think that she's a little girl just like you and that she is taking pretending she's taking her baby for a walk . 
and she's using her pussy cat for the baby . 
oh . 
tsk . 
so then she runs down the street and there's a little guy dressed up as a policeman . 
and she says , 
oh ! 
oh ! 
oh ! 
my baby's gone ! 
I don't know what's happened ! 
maybe somebody kidnapped him ! 
he's gone from the carriage . 
the policeman's there holding up traffic . 
clothes don't fit , do they ? 
no . 
no . 
I think he's probably her little brother or somebody else in the neighborhood pretending to be a policeman . 
and what's the policeman do ? 
oh . 
he sees the cat . 
yeah . 
what do you think he's saying to the lady ? 
what ? 
what do you think ? 
what do you think he says to her ? 
you tell me . 
he says , 
oh ! 
oh ! 
there there she is ! 
there's your baby . 
there's your pussy cat . 
and the lady says , 
oh ! 
I'm sorry . 
oh ! 
then you know what happens ? 
what ? 
the policeman goes down on his knees . 
and he says , 
here kitty , kitty , kitty , kitty , here kitty , kitty , kitty . 
and he's trying to get the kitty to come over . 
and what happens ? 
what happens to em ? 
what ? 
splat ! 
he's reaching for the kitty and he tries to go and grab her and bunk ! 
he falls over . 
look at her face . 
how does she look ? 
you tell me . 
pardon ? 
you tell me . 
she looks I think she looks kinda angry . 
she's saying , 
look what you did . 
you scared away my pussy cat . 
you go get him . 
tsk . 
so there they are . following after the pussy cat . 
look at that look on the pussy cat's face . 
what ? 
how does he feel ? 
how does he feel ? 
I think he's saying to himself , 
I'm going to outfox them . 
I'm going to them . 
they're not gonna get me . 
and he's going he's going in that pipe to hide . 
he thinks it's a good place . 
oh . 
I reckon . 
why ? 
maybe he thinks they can't follow him in there . 
why ? 
tsk . 
why ? 
perhaps perhaps he he thinks the pipe is too small for them to get in . 
you think they'll be able to follow him in there ? 
you do ? 
well , we'll see . 
oh there they are . trying to crawl in after the pussycat . 
and look what's happened on the other side . 
what ? 
the pussycat has come out . and is sitting on top of the pipe . 
oh . 
looking back in to see if they're gonna follow him through . 
out he comes . 
and there's the pussycat up there . 
look at that expression on the pussy's face . 
how do you think the pussy feels ? 
you tell me . 
what would the pussy be saying there ? 
you tell me . 
I'll bet she'd be saying , 
they followed me out , those people . 
I'll get away from them . 
and zoom ! 
up the hill he runs . 
and the little girl says , 
oh ! 
there he goes ! 
there he goes ! 
up the hill . 
up the hill ! 
up the hill ! 
quick ! 
quick ! 
after him ! 
get up there you policeman ! 
go after that guy ! 
ugh he says . 
he's . down there in the mud after crawling through . 
and he still hasn't gotten the pussycat . 
so she helps him up being a nice person . 
tsk . 
she gives him a little help onto his feet . 
and the pussycat's up there . 
oh ! 
are you gonna get me ? 
and ! 
she falls down on top of him . 
the pussycat thinks that's rather funny and comes down the hill . 
oh , dear . 
they fell into the puddle . 
why ? 
tsk . 
well , I bet they they didn't do it on purpose . 
I can tell you that . 
it was an accident . 
they're gonna be all wet now . 
and the pussycat takes advantage of that moment to go back in the pipe . 
and ! 
to start running through . 
“there he goes” she says . 
do ya think they're ever gonna catch that pussycat ? 
in she goes . 
eck ! 
yuck says he . 
all wet . 
why ? 
well , he's wet because he fell in the puddle . 
so they go . climbing through again . 
and when they get to the other side , what do you suppose they discover ?
the little fella who's been following are following them around since the very beginning of the story . he has caught the pussycat . as the pussy was coming out the other end of the pipe . 
remember way back here in the beginning ? 
yeah . 
where he was just watching ? 
yeah . 
he was just watching there on his trike . 
and he was joining with them , saying , 
oh ! 
when they were trying to catch the pussycat ? 
and when they 
here he is just watching . 
aw shucks he says . 
this isn't interesting . 
he's walking away . 
and he 
but he does follow them . 
hands in his pockets . 
and he sits on top of the pipe and watches all this action when they climb through . and come out the other side . and fall down . and get wet . 
and he's waiting back there so that when the pussy comes out , he catches him . 
grab ! 
he's got him . 
and there's a part . 
oo wah . 
boy , oh boy . 
look at that . 
think she'll catch him ? 
no . 
oh look carriage . 
well look who winded up in the carriage . 
how about that ? 
heh heh . 
look . 
they're all tired and beat up . 
the pussycat's walking . 
tsk . 
oh . 
she's changed her clothes . 
who is she now ? 
you tell me . 
I think she's a nurse . 
yeah . 
I think she changed into a nurse's clothes . 
yeah . 
the end . 
you like that story ? 
yes . 
let's look around and see what else we can find to play with . 
okay . 
I see I see I see some . 
what do you see ? 
come on . 
I'll show you . 
I see flowers . 
tsk . 
yes . 
it's a 
jeepers ! 
I don't know what the heck kind of flower that is . 
it's not a 
I thought it was a tulip when I first saw it but it's sure not a tulip . 
no . 
there's something in here too . 
wow ! 
little girls . 
I'm gonna play with these . 
okay . 
take the other stuff out too an see what you can do with it . 
okay . 
okay . 
two little guys . 
oops ! 
turn the steering wheel . 
uhhuh . 
and then you can take out those things . 
what are they ? 
I don't know . 
other parts of the equipment , huh ? 
yeah, . 
and you can steer this . 
mhm . 
you steer it and I'll push it . 
okay . 
was that your brakes ? 
yeah . 
I think this is the jack for when they get stuck . 
they hafta change the tire . 
they hafta jack it up . 
we have we had we have trouble with with our our tire . 
could you fix it with that ? 
uhhuh . 
okay . 
we we will watch . 
we we we need these screw are lights . 
and and and . 
here here we go . 
that's the jack . 
we hafta get that under the axle . 
this is the ax 
oo . 
everybody can't can't see the axles . 
how about that ? 
can't see the axles on this car . 
the axle is the bar that holds the that the . 
yeah . 
but it does have a screwdriver . 
yeah . 
and the screwdriver would turn these things . 
see if it does . 
okay . 
turn it . 
oh . 
it turns . 
uhhuh . 
turn it the other way . 
got it real tight that time . 
maybe you can get the whole thing apart . 
maybe I can . 
that's it . 
yes . 
it goes around that way . 
would you help me with the screwdriver ? 
yeah . 
watch me turn it a few times . 
this way and this way . 
this way . 
and you keep turning it . 
and I'll bet that'll come right off . that bumper . 
what about the other one ? 
will it come off too ? 
yeah . 
hey ! 
you got it . 
oop . 
yeah . 
that one I think . 
what a mechanic . 
you got the bumper off . 
yeah . 
that's the rear bumper .

this thing ? 
oh . 
I think that this will I this will I think this come off . 
try in . 
okay . 
Dad , how do I get it off with the screwdriver ? 
you probably just hafta turn the red part and not the yellow part . 
the hub and not the steering wheel . 
that's it . 
just turn the hub .

there's the steering wheel . 
we're taking this whole car apart .

I'm gonna fix it with this thing which my daddy . 
I see . 
but you took off our bumper too . 
yes . 
why'd you do that ? 
oh j j just to tighten it tighten it up . 
no . 
just a little bit . 
so so you won't have trouble with it . 
oh . 
that's good . 
I wouldn't wanna have any trouble with our bumper . 
okay . 
but I'm almost . 
hardly anything worse than bumper trouble . 
yup . 
worse . 
you really got that wheel off . 
yup . 
hey ! 
are you a mechanic ? 
no . 
you're not ? 
no . 
what are you ? 
I'm just a carpenter that takes your 
I'm just a . 
a carpenter , huh ? 
yeah . 
a . 
carpenters works with tools . 
yup . 
carpenters usually work . on wood . with their tools . 
yup .

just to fix it a little bit . 
our car will never roll again . 
but my but my dad will fix this . 
your daddy will ? 
yup . 
because he's a worker . 
he can fix things that that take off with with your screwdriver . 
this could be this could be a problem . 
you take everything in the world apart . 
yeah . 
and you get your daddy to put it all back together again . 
this could definitely be a problem . 
yeah . 
because you can take things apart just about faster than your daddy can put them your daddy can put them back together again . 
yes . 
I can take off here . the wheels . 
it's a good thing you know how to put things back together too . 
yes .

yeah but now how can I get this one off ? 
you can probably turn it the rest of the way with your fingers . 
when it gets loose you don't need the screwdriver anymore .

oh . 
it was right on the edge of coming off . 
I did it .

here's one tool . 
and there's one . 
oops . 
oops . 
I can't find that or 
which one are you looking for ? 
I'm looking for the orange one . 
the orange one . 
oh . 
I think that was the wrench . 
it's in the back there . 
there it is . 
if that's the one you meant . 
no . 
no . 
no . 
no . 
no . 
no . 
I hafta take it out first . 
you're not ready to have that back yet , huh ?

where does it fit ? 
on just some paint . 
ya gonna tighten up something . 
yup . 
yeah . 
tighten up something . 
oh yeah that was the one that was loose . 
now that's much better . 
hey . 
here's some 
how did these come out ? 
you took them off . when you took this bumper . 
when you took off that bumper . 
now that you fixed it , it's a good time to put it back . 
okay . 
you need these blue screws . and the bumper here . 
I'll hold it . 
okay . 
I better get all these red all these red screws off . 
now . 
I got them all off . 
you're a very neat worker the way you collect all your parts . 
yup . 
I didn't see that . 
that's what the wrench fits on . 
a wheel too . 
that's the spare tire . 
these these probably fit on here . 
gee . 
we could play with this for hours . 
it's too bad we don't have more time with this toy . 
we could do a lot . 
okay . 
but . 
fits on that 
this is a nut . 
and it fits on this bolt . 
but wait a minute . 
wait a minute . 
I think that I can take off this screw here . 
I told you this was a screw before but it's really a bolt . 
a screw has a point . 
and this is flat on the end . 
it's getting looser . 
uhhuh . 
it's gonna come off . 
yes . 
yeah . 
this is nice . 
what could we do with these spare nuts ? 
maybe we could 
oh . 
this is what . 
oh listen . 
when this bolt 
this is the bolt that held the wheel on ? 
and it went into this nut . 
that's what held it . 
yeah . 
so you can change the nuts . on this car . 
you can take that nut in and put this nut in . 
ya can interchange the nuts . 
it's a nutty car . 
Dad ? 
uhhuh ? 
you're doing fine . 
oh . 
I think it's out , honey . 
you just needta pull it . 
now let's put that tire on one of the wheels now that we've taken the new tire .

yeah . 
alright . 
and I'll get the screwdriver .

and those 
two in the back must hold on the back bumper . 
how's it going ? 
fine .
