this this story is called The great cat chase . 
it's about some people who chase a cat . 
one day when when when mama went inside and read that book . 
she did read it ? 
yeah . 
oh . gee , I never heard this story before . 
but here's a woman . pushing . a a carriage . 
a baby carriage with a cat in it . 
what a silly thing to do ! 
oh , maybe it's a little girl dressed up to be a mama . 
think so ? 
yeah . 
I think so too . 
well she went to pick a flower right here . 
one of these pretty red flowers ? 
yeah . 
and the cat jumped out . 
oh oh . 
she put her hands up and said , 
oh oh . 
where's my cat ? 
he was hiding behind this tree . 
she couldn't find him . 
she was really upset because . he jumped away , and she couldn't find him , and she didn't know where he was . 
there he is . 
there he is hiding . 
she didn't know it . 
well , she she . started to look for the cat . 
she didn't see it . 
but she saw a policeman so she thought she'd ask for some help . 
she said . 
my cat is lost . 
you see the policeman ? 
yeah . 
well , the policeman said , 
there's you cat lady, right over there . 
“oh there he is” she said . 
I'll just go get him . 
and the policeman went to get the cat but the cat . ran away . 
and now 
you know how we sometimes go to pat the cats and they run away ? 
yeah . 
well , but she wanted her cat back . 
so they started to chase the cat . 
he ran and they ran after him . 
then he ran into this . pipe . 
like a big tunnel . 
so the policemen crawled into the pipe . 
the cat was already at the other side . 
and then when the policeman came out . the cat ran up the hill . 
oh , and then the policeman helped the the lady get out of the pipe . 
and they fell down . 
oh my goodness ! 
they're pretty clumsy , aren't they ? 
yeah . 
yep . 
think they're gonna catch that cat ? 
yeah . 
yeah . 
oh my goodness . 
they fell into a puddle . 
looks pretty compromising to me . 
is is it 
are dey they wet . 
they're all wet ? 
yeah . 
look at them . 
they have wet hair . 
and then the cat jumped back in the pipe and went out the other way ! 
oh my goodness . 
then they . ran into the pipe and crawled through . 
oh , look at that . 
the little boy caught the cat . 
well . the cat jumped right up on the policeman . 
and and jumped on his head . 
and then ran up a tree . 
he's a pretty hard cat to . catch , isn't he ? 
and now the the . cat is up in the tree . 
oh . , look at them pointing . 
and the policeman climbed up the tree , trying to catch the cat . 
which he did . 
he caught him right there . 
and now what's gonna happen ? 
I don't 
oh oh . 
the policeman is falling and the cat is falling . 
well , the cat fell into the lady's arms . 
and the policeman fell right on his head . 
what happened here ? 
nothing nothing . 
nothing . 
nothing . 
oh , now the child is in the baby carriage . 
and the cat is walking right with them . 
oh , look what happened . 
what ? 
the lady went into the house . 
and she changed her clothes and when she came out , . it turns out that she was a nurse . 
now she's gonna fix up the policeman because he really got hurt when he fell out of that tree . 
and that's the end of the story .
