ow !
my foot !
I see what this is all about .
The great cat chase .
lemme see .
hm .
ahhah , isn't that a riot ?
a baby .
no .
I'd say that's a little girl .
and she looks like she's dressed up in her some of her mother's clothes or something .
she's got on high heels and a pocket book .
does that look like somebody I know ?
who ?
who get likes to get dressed up ?
who ?
I cann't imagine .
somebody named Ursula Ann ?
me .
she's giving her kitty cat a little ride in the carriage , huh ?
yeah .
oh oh !
look what happened .
she's bending over to pick a very pretty flower , and . the cat doesn't like the ride .
cats don't usually like to ride too well so . he's trying to run out of the carriage when she's not looking .
she turns around and she goes 
oh no .
she sees the blanket on the ground and the cat's gone .
course he knows where she is , he's peeking at her from behind the tree .
she runs off to get a policeman because she cann't find her cat .
she's really kind of worried .
and she finds a policeman .
and .. 
what she say ?
there's a little body , she oh 
I don't know , she probably says 
oh dear , oh dear , my cat has run away , and I cann't find him .
the policeman . puts up his hand .
see he's saying 
stop .
oop .
they turn around and there's the cat , sitting right there looking at them .
they probably feel kinda foolish now .. cause they thought he was missing and he wasn't at all .
so 
here kitty , kitty , kitty .
kitty , kitty .
cat doesn't wanna be caught , you know .
they don't like to be .
he's looking at them as if to say 
well you catch me if you can .
whoop !
the policeman tries to reach him and he cann't .
he falls over .
the little boy's laughing .
and the little girl's very angry .
she's kinda disgusted with him that he cann't couldn't catch the cat .
so they're still calling him , and they're walking . after the cat to try to catch him .
an the cat's looking back at them .
he's gonna go through this big pipe .
and he's probably gonna hide on them .
I would imagine .
oh no !
look at this .
he crawled into there and he's gonna make all of them crawl through there to catch him .
look at him .
he's peeking . in to see where they are .
oh isn't that funny ?
what ?
well it's really a boy dressed up .
but . he's gonna fall onto the end an there's water down there .
they're not gonna like that too well .
he falls in the water , and he helps the little girl out .
the cat in the meantime is watching .
he's probably having a real ball watching them fall in 
oh no , look at that , he fell right in the h in head first into the water .
now . .
oop .
now there he goes back in the pipe again .
oh they're so mad now .
oh no , that was clever .
see the little boy ?
he was sitting at the other end waiting , and he got the kitty when he came out .
he lost him .
there he is hopping on that little boy's head .
oh they must be furious with that cat , huh ?
now he's gonna climb the tree .
now they're gonna have a great time getting him out of the tree .
he climbs up the tree .
the kitty cat's hanging on by one limb , grabs a hold of him .
whoops there goes the branch .
it's ready to crack .
oh oh .
there it goes snap !
he's fallen down .
you think that's funny ?
the man 
well the branch wasn't strong enough to hold him , so he's gonna fall .
thud , right on the ground .
well . they're all kinda battered and bruised and they're tired of trying to find that cat .
there he 
look at him .
he's walking along behind just as . like nothing happened .
is is he a baby ?
no , I think he's kinda tired out so they put him in the carriage . I guess .
I know he's awfully tired .
look at him .
he ca he's sitting down resting .
and the little girl 
I dunno what she's up to .
oh she says 
wait a minute .
and she goes in the house , and she comes out with some iced tea . and cookies .
oh !
she figures they need a little refreshment after trying to catch that kitty cat , huh ?
they all look rather happy , don't they ?
now now can we 
I think you know what we oughta do ?
